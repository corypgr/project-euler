/**
 * Problem 97
 *
 * https://projecteuler.net/problem=97
 *
 * For this it looks like I just need to calculate 28433 Ã— 2^7830457 + 1. We could do the multiplication in a loop,
 * keeping only the last 10 digits (the relevant bits) during the multiplications. However, I think Java's BigInteger
 * can solve this one.
 * -----------
 * The above works, but it's pretty slow. It runs in around 4 seconds. I'll try my looping strategy outlined above and
 * see if that's a faster solution. It runs in less than 100 ms with this solution.
